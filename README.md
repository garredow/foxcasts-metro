## What is it?

Foxcasts Metro is a basic podcast manager app. YOu can subscribe and listen to all your favorite podcasts. It's powered by Podcast Index.

## Why did you build it?

There are two primary reasons. I wanted to make an app in the style of the old Window Phone Metro UI. I also wanted to test out my new [foxcasts-core](https://github.com/garredow/foxcasts-core) library and see how fast I could build something with it.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/garredow/foxcasts-lite.git
cd foxcasts-core
npm install
npm start
```

Please note that this works best on mobile devices or phone-sized browser windows.
